# Nextflow PostgreSQL cache

Nextflow's PostgreSQL Cache Plugin enables the storage of task execution metadata in a PostgreSQL database, ensuring data persistence and scalability. This plugin is particularly useful for workflows that require robust, centralized caching mechanisms across distributed environments.

Add the plugin to your `nextflow.config` , configure it to connect with a postgre database and ... this is all.
The plugin will create required tables and will store tasks context when you run your pipeline

Among a way to *Centralized Cache Storage*, using this plugin, you're able to see log executions in real time
